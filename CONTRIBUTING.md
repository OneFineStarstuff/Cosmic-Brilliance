## Development Setup

### Jupyter Notebooks

Most implementations are in Jupyter notebooks. When contributing:
- Clear all outputs before committing
- Include markdown cells explaining the physics/AI concepts
- Add comments to complex mathematical operations
- Test notebooks end-to-end before submission

1. Ensure your code follows the project's style guidelines
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Add tests for new functionality where applicable
4. Ensure all notebooks run without errors
5. Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Include more details in the body if necessary

## Style Guidelines

### Python Code

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Comment complex physics equations and AI architectures

### Jupyter Notebooks

- Use markdown cells to explain concepts and methodology
- Include mathematical formulations where relevant
- Add visualizations to illustrate results
- Structure notebooks with clear sections

### Documentation

- Write clear, concise documentation
- Include examples where helpful
- Explain the physics/AI concepts for broader accessibility
- Update README.md if adding major features

## Community

### Getting Help
